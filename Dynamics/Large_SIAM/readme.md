# SIAM - Spectral Functions in the Thermodynamic limit

The main file is run_dynamics.py in the Embedding directory while all the other files are helper files.

The file delta_peaks_to_spectral_fn_broadening.py is used to generate smooth spectral functions from discrete delta peaks 
obtained after executing run_dynamics.py
