# SIAM
Exact and approximate electronic structure calculations of the single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM) used as a solver for model high-T superconducting materials

This module evaluates ground-state and dynamic properties of SIAM with numerically exact methods (finite-systems) and the Embedding technique discussed in Phys. Rev. B 95, 155111.

For finite-sized SIAM the results from the embedding scheme is compared to those obtained from numerically exact results - exact diagonalization

For infinite (large) SIAM, the results from the embedding scheme is compared to those obtained from more expensive numerical methods like the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG)
